What is it?
-----------

Kyles Kids is a make believe foundation that helps alcoholic toddlers either a) quit drinking or b) drink like
champions like Kyle.

What's the Tech Stack?
----------------------
K-K is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org "Flask is tight") app running on a [DO](https://www.digitalocean.com/) Ubuntu box. It is
served with [nginx](http://nginx.org)/[gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org) and is daemonized with [UpStart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/). If
you are a noob, this may sound complicated.  **It's not!!** I got the whole thing up and running in under 30 minutes, *including SSL*.

How can you do the things I said above?
----------------------------------------
For now, just email me.  It's my GitHub handle at gmail.  I am going to write about all of them in this Readme, though, so
soon it will be easy breezy.
